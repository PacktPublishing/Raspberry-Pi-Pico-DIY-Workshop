## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from machine import Pin
import utime
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
while True:
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for students, teachers, engineers, scientists, artists, and tech enthusiasts who want to develop embedded systems that drive cost-effective automation, IoT, robotics, medical devices, and art projects. If you consider yourself a maker and would like to learn how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico, then this book is for you. Familiarity with Python programming, MicroPython, CircuitPython, embedded hardware, and peripherals is helpful but not mandatory to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-12).
